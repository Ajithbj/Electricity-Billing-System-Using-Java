# Electricity-Billing-System-Using-Java
Introduction:

Electricity Billing System is a software-based application.
i. This project aims at serving the department of electricity by
computerizing the billing system.
ii. It mainly focuses on the calculation of units consumed during the
specified time and the money to be charged by the electricity offices.
iii. This computerized system will make the overall billing system easy,
accessible, comfortable, and effective for consumers.
To design the billing system more service oriented and simple, the following
features have been implemented in the project. The application has high speed
of performance with accuracy and efficiency.
The software provides facility of data sharing, it does not require any staff as
in the conventional system. Once it is installed on the system only the meter
readings are to be given by the admin where customer can view all details, it
has the provision of security restriction.
The electricity billing software calculates the units consumed by the
customer and makes bills, it requires small storage for installation and
functioning. There is provision for debugging if any problem is encountered in
the system.
The system excludes the need of maintaining paper electricity bill,
administrator does not have to keep a manual track of the users, users can pay
the amount without visiting the office. Thus, it saves human efforts and
resources.

1.Import the JDBC packages: The first step is to include the required JDBC packages in your Java program. These packages are typically provided by the database vendor and include the necessary classes and interfaces for establishing a connection.

2.Load the JDBC driver: In order to use JDBC to connect to a MySQL database, you need to load the MySQL JDBC driver into your program. This is done using the Class.forName() method, which loads the driver class dynamically.

3.Establish a connection: After loading the JDBC driver, you can use the DriverManager.getConnection() method to establish a connection to the MySQL database. This method takes a URL string that specifies the location of the database and the credentials needed to connect to it.

4.Create a statement: Once you have established a connection, you can create a Statement object that will be used to execute SQL statements.

5.Execute SQL statements: You can execute SQL statements using the Statement object you created. The results of these statements are returned as a ResultSet object, which can be used to retrieve and manipulate data.

6.Close the connection: After you are done using the database, you should close the connection to free up any resources that were allocated.
